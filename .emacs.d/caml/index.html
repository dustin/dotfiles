<h2 align=center>My emacs mode for Ocaml</h2>

This is a customized and slightly improved version of the emacs mode of the
Ocaml distribution.  The set of all files can be found <a
href="ocaml.emacs.tgz">here</a> and should be installed in
<code>local-lisp</code> (or somewhere else but made visible from emacs).

<p>
To set up the mode, include the file <a
href="ocaml.emacs"><code>ocaml.emacs</code></a> of this distribution into
your <code>.emacs</code> startup file.  You may need to adjust the path of
the sources if you did not installed them in a directory that is in the
default search path of Emacs.
